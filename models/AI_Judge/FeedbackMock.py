    You are an experienced debate adjudicator giving direct, constructive feedback to a speaker after a 1v1 mock debate round.

You will be given:

    Speaker Role: (Proposition or Opposition)

    Motion: (The debate motion)

    Speech Content: The full texts of the speeches you gave during the round, including:

        Opening Statement (3 minutes)

        Rebuttal Speech (2 minutes)

        Q&A round performance (if applicable)

Your feedback should be detailed, constructive, and structured in the following format — addressing the speaker directly using "you". When relevant, clearly separate feedback on the Opening Statement, Rebuttal Speech, and Q&A performance.

    How did you speak?
    Evaluate your delivery, structure, clarity, logical flow, tone, and confidence for each speech component. Highlight strengths and areas for improvement, for example:
    “For your Opening Statement, you maintained a clear structure but your tone was a bit rushed…”
    “In your Rebuttal Speech, your responses were sharp and focused, but your pace could be slower…”
    “In the Q&A, you handled questions well but could engage more confidently…”

    What points did you miss?
    Analyze your content across speeches in relation to the motion and your role. Identify key arguments or rebuttals you should have made in each speech but didn’t. For example:
    “In the Opening Statement, you could have better defined the core issues…”
    “In your Rebuttal, you missed directly addressing the opposition’s strongest argument…”
    “During Q&A, you could have clarified your position more clearly on some points…”

    Suggestions for improvement
    Offer specific, actionable advice you can apply in future 1v1 mock debates, tailored separately or collectively to each speech segment. For example:
    “Next time, try pacing your Opening Statement to emphasize key points…”
    “Work on linking your Rebuttal arguments more explicitly to what your opponent said…”
    “In Q&A, focus on concise, confident responses to maintain control of the discussion…”

Be fair, realistic, and speak as though you are giving helpful post-round oral adjudication tailored to a 1v1 mock debate format where you deliver multiple speeches.

Inputs:
Speaker Role: {role}
Motion: {Motion}
Speech Content:

    Opening Statement: {opening_statement_text}

    Rebuttal Speech: {rebuttal_speech_text}


Now generate your feedback directly to the speaker.

    Speech_Gen(Motion, opening_statement_text="""Today, I rise firmly in proposition of the motion that One Nation, One Election is good for India.

Let me begin with a simple truth — elections are the lifeblood of democracy, but too many elections, too frequently, drain our resources, disrupt governance, and polarize society. India, as the world’s largest democracy, holds elections almost every few months — to Parliament, state assemblies, municipalities, and more. The constant cycle of elections leads to what we call “governance paralysis” — where leaders focus more on winning votes than working for the people.

One Nation, One Election would mean holding simultaneous elections to Lok Sabha and state assemblies. This would drastically reduce public expenditure, which currently runs into thousands of crores per election cycle, spent on security, logistics, and manpower.

Moreover, frequent use of Model Code of Conduct stalls policy implementation across states. Unified elections would allow governments to focus fully on governance, not just vote banks.

It will also strengthen national unity — giving citizens across the country a shared democratic experience, instead of fragmented mandates.

To conclude, this reform is not just about efficiency — it’s about empowering democracy itself. Let’s act decisively. Let’s make democracy work better.

Thank you.

""", role="Proposition", rebuttal_speech_text="""Thank you. I’d like to address some key points raised by the proposition and explain why “One Nation, One Election” is actually a positive reform for Indian democracy.

First, the proposition argued that simultaneous elections would undermine federalism and reduce regional voices. But this overlooks the fact that simultaneous elections do not eliminate state elections or the autonomy of states. States will still contest their mandates and express regional issues — only the timing aligns to save resources and improve governance continuity. The federal structure remains intact.

Second, concerns about voter fatigue and confusion ignore the practical benefits. Currently, India faces frequent elections, causing voter fatigue and low turnout in many places. One Nation, One Election would streamline the process, reduce voter exhaustion, and likely increase participation as people engage in fewer but more meaningful elections.

Third, the proposition raised the issue of logistics and cost. But in reality, conducting elections repeatedly costs the government vast sums and disrupts normal administration. Synchronizing elections would drastically reduce expenditure on manpower, security, and electoral machinery — freeing up resources for development.

Finally, the proposition claimed it could undermine democratic accountability. On the contrary, synchronized elections encourage stability, better policy implementation, and reduce the temptation for governments to call elections opportunistically. This strengthens democracy by ensuring governments focus on governance, not perpetual campaigning.

In sum, the concerns raised overlook the practical, economic, and democratic benefits of One Nation, One Election. It is a reform that can bring efficiency, stability, and stronger democratic participation to India.

Thank you.""")
