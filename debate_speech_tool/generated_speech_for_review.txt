--- Scenario 1: Pro Exploring Mars (3 points) ---
Today, I will compellingly argue that Exploring Mars is not just beneficial, it is essential, and I will lay out precisely why. A crucial piece of evidence supporting Exploring Mars is its profound effect on its role in solving complex global challenges. Consider, for a moment, the significant advancements Exploring Mars brings to the economic benefits it unlocks. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize how Exploring Mars revolutionizes the enhancement of human potential it offers. Some might attempt to discredit Exploring Mars by pointing to hypothetical issues. This perspective, however, is fundamentally flawed. Therefore, to embrace progress and secure a better future, we must champion Exploring Mars. The case is clear, the time to act is now.

--- Scenario 2: Con Autonomous Weapons (2 points) ---
It is with a great sense of urgency that I must state: the notion of Autonomous Weapons is fraught with peril, and I will meticulously outline the dangers. Moreover, the inherent dangers of Autonomous Weapons for the unforeseen negative consequences that could arise are simply unacceptable. We cannot ignore the severe risks Autonomous Weapons poses to the inherent risk of misuse and exploitation. Proponents will undoubtedly sing praises of Autonomous Weapons, citing supposed benefits. Yet, they conveniently ignore the fundamental flaws, which I will expose. Thus, for the sake of prudence and safety, we are compelled to reject Autonomous Weapons outright.
